Many moons ago, the deft movement of a leopardess ghosting through the trees of South India, sparked my love affair with the forest. What sparked yours? Id love to know in the comments below! I'm taking some much-needed time off today to answer all comments and DM's.

I spent the week exploring the foothills. Nothing encapsulates the essence of life better than the monsoon jungle. Cloud kissed mountains, ancient trees, flowers in bloom and endless shades of green. This is home and I'm fortunate to share it with some incredible animals.
.
.
Here are two leopards, the first was an absolute dream as a curious young male drifted through the flowering lantana with the hills in the backdrop. The second is of an old leopardess who sat on the ancient Banyan. The tree symbolizes life and is one of her favourites and everytime she sits there I can't help but feel like it's protecting her from the passing of time.
.
.
The essence of these pictures is best captured wide and the S21 Ultra offers incredible versatility. I captured these #withGalaxy S21 Ultra and composed them using 108MP and the 3x optical zoom.

In the winter winds of dawn, no birds shall sing, for the night still walks.

These two photographs, of the same individual, were taken four years apart. A stranger in this forest, on a cold winter morning he drifted in with the mist. He was young, elusive, lean and full of mystery. His journey had just begun. Four years later (swipe to see the second photograph), the forest now belonged to him. He defied the odds of natural selection to not just survive, but thrive in a decidous forest where most believed he didn't belong. He is now dominant, bold and powerful. A true king.
.
.
Photography note: I chose a habitat picture with the trees in the backdrop to best depict his early life as a stranger. I wanted the in-focus trees to act as spectators, watchful sentinels that were keeping an eye on him. For the second photo, I wanted to match the elements (morning mist, warm light, green grass) but with the trees out of focus. A shallow depth of field that brought him to the centre stage (hence no Rule of Thirds) to signify his reign. He now owned those trees, he was the jungles focal point and and the jungle now belonged to him.

Of all the animals I've photographed, Giraffes seem to have the most insatiable curiosity to know everything. On a cloudy afternoon, I sat under an Acacia tree near my tent. It was the only place I could catch a bar of signal to send a few emails. I was soon greeted by this tower of Giraffes that were most intrigued by my presence. I quickly realised I was under their favourite tree and quietly walked away, but never without a quick photograph!
.

Shooting against the sky can be tricky but with the S21 Ultra on #ProMode, I chose to expose for the Giraffe and reduce the highlights on the sky later in post.

Approaching dawn. The forest may appear still, but under the blue veil of mist, life is emerging.

A wider perspective always helps accentuate the incredible depth of a jungle. On this misty morning the true beauty lay not with the leopardess, but in the elements of dawn that cradled her. Always use the essence of the forest to compliment the subject rather than fixating on just the subject. This photograph was captured #withGalaxy S21 Ultra on #ProMode.

As explorers of the wild, we are always on a visual quest to capture those little moments, like thousands of little strings woven into the fabric of time. So when @samsungindia asked me to review their new T7 Touch SSD, I knew what I had to. I had to tell a story that captured the essence of time.

A few miles downriver from our Camp, breathes a lost world that I've been documenting over the past decade. 8k and 4k raw footage, thousands of photographs, slow motion videos and more. I'm often asked how I manage all my media on safari and make videos remotely, like the one above. The answer lies in my pocket. The Samsung T7 Touch SSD is portable, secure and powerful. This is where I catch time.

Water is life, and I enjoy using the elements to tell a story. The monsoon is here, and I wanted to show the importance of rain and how every drop matters. I chose a macro perspective and focused on smaller creatures of the everchanging jungle, who wore these drops of life. I captured these photographs #withGalaxy S21Ultra at 108MP to show you the incredible detail that often lies hidden.

As the labyrinth lured us into its narrow trails, the mist thickened, and we noticed something move in the leafy canopy above. What appeared to be a branch at first, was now moving towards us. Unseen, in a beautiful shade of jungle green, with horizontal pupils that allow greater vision, she carefully studied us. With a soft hiss the jungle went quiet, and the steady hymn of crickets died instantly. From the thick veil of mist, she summoned the others, each with a distinct pair of eyes and patterned skin. The air was now enchanted and the arrival of the diviners had begun.

A labyrinth of trees hung over trails less trodden. Silent paths lay blanketed by fallen leaves and were preserved by the jungle's early guardians. In tribal folklore, it's believed that on the first winter morning, the future could be seen in eye of the Diviners. In search of uncovering the truth, I was warned to tread carefully as the trails of the diviner were guarded by the keepers of this kingdom; the mighty elephants. Their tusks, white as the winter mist, illuminated the path ahead and as we ventured further into the jungle‚Äôs distant chambers, I could feel a growing sense of divinity.

At the end of the season, after thousands of miles traveled in pursuit of the wild, with dusty cameras, worn out shoes and a few worthy photographs, I find myself at the same crossroads. A new season beckons, with new worlds to discover and new creatures to meet, but an artists mind get tired quick. Year after year, the search for a greater imagination, new inspiration and finding untapped corners of the creative mind, gets harder and harder. So what keeps bringing me back? Back to the gates of dawn, fresh as the morning air, at the first sunrise of a new season. What still keeps me going? Thousands of sunrises have passed, thousands to come, yet the answer always remains the same. Uncovering a leopards labyrinth at first light, is why I do what I do. It's why I embarked on this journey and it's what keeps the road ahead boundless, with infinte horizons.

Here's a beautiful leopard, with eyes as blue as the sky, from the Serengeti at sunrise. What an incredible sight.

"Twilight. Shadows of the impending night slowly grew as they cradled the last hues of daylight. All creatures of the day must give way for the night's faithful, as the suns disciples fade into the dark. But there is one that holds, both the sun and the moon, in her eyes. She who orchestrates the changing of guard between day and night. The twilight princess of the Elder Forests." ¬©shaazjung

Two beatiful beings, two mere threads, in an intricate tapestry woven by the web of life. The little butterfly is natures greatest symbol of change and the mighty tiger is a symbol of hope. Both of them have the ability to shape ecosystems, both bound together. Today on #InternationalTigerDay , I'd love for us to also look at the bigger picture. This isn't just about tigers, it's about our very existence. We are all interconnected, each of us a little thread, integral to conserving the tapestry we're woven into. Small changes can have large effects on our environment and I've used the butterfly in the picture to signify this 'butterfly effect'.
.
.
The tiger is our greatest guardian. Protecting them, helps protect our forests, rivers and climate. Ive dedicated today to my most favourite tigress with four pictures of her. I‚Äôve had the privilege of documenting her for the past seven years. Today, she's a mother of three and an incredible symbol of power and hope for our forests. May her tribe grow.

"Somewhere in the distant depths of the old forest, grows an Elden Tree. Under its divine aura, I've counted many a leaf fall, each with refined elegance as they floated without a care in the winds of change.

The tree belonged to a beautiful pair of leopards that descended with incredible grace. It is believed, by the Elders, that these leopards learnt their ways from the Elden Tree. Their patterns of movement, similar in behavior to the falling leaf."

Hello lovely people of Instagram. I don't usually put up images of myself. To be honest, I don't have many and I prefer to be behind the lens. But yesterday was World Camera Day and today is World Social Media Day and my inbox is inundated with people asking me to share pictures of me in the field with my equipment. So here's a little series of me on the top of a hill, trying to photograph a Black Eagle hunt in the valley below (or just me posing and acting like I am). Sadly, the only bird interested that day was this Magpie Robin that was on a mission to ruin my camera's focus tracking.
.

I want to use this opportunity to thank you guys. You'll inspire to push the boundaries everyday and in return, if my work inspires even a fraction of this incredible following, I'll rest happy. Peace and love üñ§

The arrival of the birds, against the setting sun, the gathering of herds, the forest breathes as one, the dragonflies are here, summer light in their wings, the spiders weave their webs with magic in their strings, the last cuckoo calls as the sun begins to fall, the elements await, for the tiger to summon all.
.

Without these incredible creatures, our country would have fewer forests, trees, rivers and rainfall. Tigers are a keystone species, vital to the ecosystem. In a withering world, where development is rampant, their ecosystems are more fragile than ever. The age of conflict between man and animal is now here and without a united will to restore the old earth, we will lose the very essence of our existence. I recently watched the movie #sherni that encapsulates this conflict and the importance of conservation, especially amongst the locals.

This is the way. This is the jungle."

I come from a forest as green as the parakeets plume, where iridescent leopards wait for the first flowers of the monsoon to bloom.

The Lantana Camara is a nonindigenous weed that now grows wild in the forests of South India. It's overpowering ability to devour the undergrowth has not just changed the ecosystem but also the behavior of the animals that inhabit these forests. Every year, during the start of the monsoon, the Lantana flowers pink, purple and orange. On a peaceful monsoon evening, I managed to frame a family of three leopards amidst this incredible burst of colour.

It won't be long before the first flock of Srawberry Finches arrive to drop their feathers, dipped in Soma, on the earth. Wait for their red plume to bloom, don't fear the flame. Wait for the earth to turn red and remember my name."
.

A short excerpt from my book of a Tribesman desribing the 'Butea Monosperma', my most favourite deciduous tree, also known as 'Flame of the Forest'. Meet some the inhabitants of the Scarlet Gardens in the pictures above. The flaming backdrop belongs to the orange-red flowers of this tree that blossom only in summer.

Come rain or shine, the joys I have possesed, inspite of fate, are mine.

I love the onset of the monsoon, just before the gates of rain open. The forest is at its most vibrant and at dawn that day, we watched shadows in the west bow to the rising sun. Rain drops sparkled in the atmosphere and from the last of the night, he emerged, to greet the new day and vanish into its depths. All mornings are magical, but some are just ethereal.

To sit beneath the night and wait for the coming of dawn, inspired by the birds that are first to sing. To watch the color slowly come back into the world, as silver dew-laden grass sparkles under the glow of first light. Every day at the gates of dawn I wait, to be born again.
.
.
To capture the arrival of dawn, I wanted to show a dark forest, lit by the first light. Captured #withGalaxy S21 Ultra and I used its Pro Mode to heavily underexpose my image and increased the white balance to add a warm glow. I chose to shoot wide with the primary lens to accentuate the essence of the enchanted forest. One of my favorite subjects to photograph against the light is the Langur monkey and here are three photographs, from three different mornings. These sentinels of the forest are the first to rise and keep a watchful eye.

The inhabitants of the Eastern corridors that border the impenetrable forest, always carry an important message. No matter how much we love these animals, document them for decades, watch them grow and see them go, it's important to understand that they belong to the wild. Anthropomorphism towards animals is rooted deep in our experiences, most prevelant in our childhood, through movies and books. Attaching human emotion and  characteristics to animals (Lion King, Jungle Book, Winnie the Pooh) allows us to connect with them, in the hope that we can understand them better. It inspires us in many ways and allows us to dream, but it's important to draw a line and understand the unrealistic expectations we create around these wild animals. We as humans are emotional beings and I've documented several individuals over decades, named them for my personal use and couldn't help but learn to deeply love them. But the truth about these animals is that they know nothing about us. There are no bonds created between man and animal in these forests of the untamed, no Mowglis and Bhageeras. These jungles are wild and may they remain wild forever.

What goes up must come down, but not if there's a pack of Dholes guarding the base of the tree. The resident pack of Asiatic wild dogs had chased this black panther up a tree and just when he thought it was safe to descend, he was quickly reminded of their presence below and sent right back up.

Captured #withGalaxy on the #GalaxyS21Ultra. I absolutely love the wider perspective but it's important to also build little sequences and the 10x optical zoom is incredible at doing that. Have a look at the quality as I switch between 1x and 10x. This was shot in extremely low light.

Deep in the Elder Forests, as the sun moves in cycles, the ancient trees went and gathered their first disciples." - Short excerpt from my upcoming book.
.
.
The arboreal leopard and the trees of the forest are inseparable. Without the other, the two are incomplete. It's so important to frame your subject in a way that tells a compelling story. We spotted this leopardess by the beaten track, waiting to cross. The giant bark of the Yellow Teak tree in the backdrop was the perfect subject to align my subject (the leopard) with. Further in the distance stood a wooded grove of Crocodile Bark, Teak and Axle Wood trees. Captured #withGalaxy S20 FE on its 3x Optical Zoom that helped encapsulate the essence of the leopard in her habitat. Wide enough to tell a story, close enough to amplify my subjects.

On a cold winter morning in 2009, a stranger drifted in the mist (Image 2). Deft as the wind, he moved low with incredible stealth, unseen by the large herd of deer that grazed by us. He had powerful bone structure, but hadn't fully developed. You could tell he was still young, a wandering male in search of new territory. In typical leopard like fashion, he dissapeared as quickly as he'd arrived, not to be seen again. Three years passed and on a dreary monsoon evening, we met a local tribesman who claimed to have seen a tiger with spots. We knew he'd mistaken the cat for a leopard but why? He pointed down the road and as we took the bend, I still remember the sound of people gasping. Up ahead on the beaten track, stood the largest leopard I had ever seen (Image 1). He was colossal but moved with phenomenal agility and something about him felt familiar. It took us a day to connect the dots back to the wandering male we saw in 2009. Three years had passed and it was incredible to see how he had grown. Little did we know from that day onwards, he would grow to be one of the most iconic leopards in the area and reign for the next decade.

At the arrival of a new day, the garden at first may seem still, transfixed by the coming of dawn. Only the light moves, waltzing through the shadows of time, as she slowly lifts the veil of night away. And in the depths of the waking forest, the ancient trees cradle the first light, waiting for the earth to breath first life.

In the animal kingdom, the eyes of the Indian chameleon, the vibrant coat of a winter tiger and the unique spot patterns of the ever elusive leopard are few of my most favourite features. If I had to add one more to that list, it would have to be the ears of the Caracal. Over 20 muscles in their ears allow them to swivel each with ease and detect even the slightest of sounds. These incredible hunters are fastest of the African small cats and the most elusive of all. In my ten years in Tanzania, I've only had two photographable opportunities and we were lucky to share our camp this year with this bold individual. (Swipe to see video).

In these dense forests of South India, the mysterious ways of the solitary bear has always been of incredible intrigue. These elusive beings, almost illusory in my jungle book of life, appear usually at dusk, like a lonesome spirit that lingers in the fleeting twilight. A few days ago, at sundown we bumped into this curious individual who stood on his hind legs to get a good look at us. These Sloth Bears are nocturnal and have a strong sense of smell but very poor sight. The people of the forest have immense respect for them and keep their distance as they're easily surprised and can be unpredictable and aggressive.

Captured #withGalaxy S21 Ultra at 108MP in very low light. The aim was to capture the bear in his natural ambiance, against the setting sun in the twilight forest.

This week's highlight was seeing one of my most favourite leopardesses after a year. We've documented her for over a decade and it's hard to explain what it means to us. The feeling is indescribable and yes, this is a wild animal but it's impossible to remove the element of emotion when you've shared a decade of memories together. Connecting these experiences with nature, string by string, through the fabric of time, has weaved who I truly am.

The first picture is her today, and second picture of her (swipe) was photographed in April 2011. Exactly 11 years ago. Eternal beauty. May she grow old gracefully üñ§

I reside by a beautiful river in South India, home to an incredible density of asiatic wildlife. At this time of the year, as the waters recede, herds of elephants congregate here for fresh feed and water. To sit by the banks and observe these giants, especially during the pre-monsoon showers, is a divine experience that grounds even the highest souls. It's so important to be humbled by the powerful elements of nature and nothing does that better than a large tusker in a brewing storm.

We as explorers of the wild are on an endless quest, forever in search of our next adventure. On my travels I've met many wonderful beings, but nothing captivates me more and lures me into its gaze than the eye of a Chameleon. These animals can move their eyes separately and can see 360 degrees. They have the ability to transition between monocular and binocular vision, which allows them to view objects with either eye independently, or with both eyes together.

The forest and her twisted trees, each like a silent sentinel that guards the unknown, each with a responsibility. Some trees reach for the sky to find the light, others lay low and cradle the dark.
.
.
Every tree holds incredible power with the ability to adapt, communicate and heal. The time has come for us to accept these trees as sentient beings, each with their own character, just like humans. As a race, if we can collectively accept this, we can save our forests. So the next time you go into the jungle, notice the trees, their beautiful shapes, and their incredible social structures. Over the past 15 years, I've watched some of my favourite trees in this forest grow old and fall. To see creatures like the panther rest on them against a wooded backdrop is a breath taking sight.

It's 'International Day of Forests'. Without them there would be no ecosystems, no balance, no oxygen, no animals and no humans. The age of man versus nature is here, unfolding everyday in front of your very eyes. Unless we strive to work towards a new era of restoration and growth, you and I are a part of an irreversible truth, fed by a system of lies that makes us believe we live in a healthy world. Don't be fooled by the clear sky as the smoke disperses into the ether. Be the change that you seek and help others around you understand the social, economic and ecological benefits of our forests. I hope this page has been a portal to my enchanted forest and it's incredible to see how far we've come. Thank for you for all the love and support and stay woke üëäüèΩ

Over the past year, my journey with Samsung has been exciting and has challenged me in many ways. Uncovering the wilderness with my galaxy devices, requires an entirely new perspective, where we have to push the boundaries of phone photography to not just create visually powerful content, but also tell a story.

When shooting wide, it's important to use the elements to weave your imagery and on this misty morning, I decided to use the 8k video capabilites on the #Galaxys21ultra. The 8k video allows me to extract 33 megapixel stills. Swipe to see the snap. Video above shot on the phone.

Close your eyes and picture the coming of my dawn. A misty maze of crooked trees lies buried in obscurity. Fallen branches rot in silence as the songbirds dare not rise. A warm glow of first light hangs between the trees, illuminating parts of the moss ridden trail below that belongs to the keepers of this kingdom. The art of the ancient jungle at dawn, lies in listening. I‚Äôve seen many things here, but to hear them first on an obscure misty morning is an ethereal experience.

At first light, we heard the earth crackle as something large moved on the mist covered path ahead. We had no idea what it was as we sat on edge and waited for it to emerge and when he did, it was a sight to behold.

Ten years ago, on a misty summer morning, I met my most favourite leopardess. She was as beautiful as she was shy and played hide and seek with us on an incredibly beautiful tree. Little did I know she was going to grow to be one of the most dominant females in the area and mother several litters that would help turn this forest into the land of leopards. I've had many encounters with the spotted kind, but this sighting, over a decade ago, will always hold a very special place in my heart.

Shaaz Jung & Nikon Z7II | Together as one

My father was an avid wildlife photographer who spent hours in the early 90's using reels, tanks and various liquid concentrates and chemical processes to develop his own photographs on film. Film back then was expensive and cameras like the Nikon F90X and F60D taught me how to value every photograph. Twenty years later, here I am, using their new mirrorless technology to unravel the wilderness, as the ambassador for Nikon in India. It's been an incredible journey and together, we've created powerful visual imagery that has hopefully inspired millions across the world. Thank you @nikonindiaofficial for your loyalty and support.

My mind tends to drift like a veil of blue mist, under the complex structure of trees, far into the jungles cosmos. I‚Äôve spent my whole life stuck in this labyrinth, in search of the answers, hoping that one day one of the paths will lead me to the ultimate truth. After years of wander, I‚Äôve come to realise that there is no path, there are no answers. The essence of the maze is to keep getting lost until you master your labyrinth and the ultimate truth is to discover who you really are.

The passage above was inspired by this picture of the panther, shot from my @samsungindia #GalaxyS21Ultra at 108MP. To watch how leopards unlock the forest with their incredible intelligence and deft movement has been a phenomenal journey. To capture them in their habitat with wider frames from my Galaxy devices allows me to tell a story and here‚Äôs a story of a leopard uncovering his tangled forest, a maze of trees, until he ultimately discovers who he is; the king of this labyrinth.

What you seek is seeking you. (Photographed from my window in the city).
.
.
On a warm afternoon in Bangalore city, I sat by my window, under a grove of everygreen and deciduous trees that arched over us. The arrival of summer brings change and the garden below was now covered in a bed of fallen leaves. A little borewell was used to water this garden and formed a pool of water that caught my attention. I spent the next few days on my porch with a pair of binoculars.
.
.
On day five, I noticed a flash of white. A fleeting yet familiar sight of a ribbon like creature darting through the air. It's hard to describe the ethereal beauty of a paradise flycatcher ghosting through the atmosphere. Enchanting, alluring and soul-shaking. This has always been my most favourite bird, and to find it in my very own garden felt supernatural. "What you seek is seeking you".

The haunting beauty of the forest at dawn lies not in what you see, but in the obscurity that makes the world around you deceptively apparent.
.

It's #WorldWildlifeDay and at dawn the light was low and the air was blue as silhouettes of trees hung silently over us. Deep in the melancholic mist, I waited for the first ghost to drift. With the #GalaxyS21Ultra in my hand, I wanted to encapsulate the eerie essence of dawn by using the dimly lit forest to my advantage. Under the glow of first light, we saw an obscure form in the distance slowly take shape. On Pro Mode, I chose a slow shutter and low ISO and the trick was to track the subject while clicking. This panning technique allowed me to keep the subject in focus, in extreme low light, and add a ghostly sense of motion that was perfect for what I was trying to portray. Here are two shots and a little ‚Äòbehind the scenes‚Äô video of what a tiger looks like in the misty forests of dawn.

Water is life and as the winter winds fade and the northern geese arrive, the sweet smell of summer slowly creeps into the atmosphere.

A new day beckons and I wanted to capture her story with my @samsungindia #GalaxyS21Ultra by these waters of the wild.
My Galaxy devices have always enabled me to push the boundaries of my creativity and I spent the day uncovering this beautiful landscape with some incredible features.

I love visitng places that make you realise how small you really are. The backwaters of Kabini is a beautiful little ecosystem that does just that. Ancient trees flank the banks as tall clumps of bamboo loom heavy over the placid waters. A haven for the prehistoric, where giants are summoned. The fresh grass, abundance of water and open scapes attract herds of elephants from far away lands. Drifting down these narrow creeks in a boat is an incredible experience that really puts the earth and our existence into perspective.

I ventured into the wilderness with my @samsungindia #GalaxyS21Ultra and the aim was to capture 8k videos from a moving boat.

Day one in the wilderness with the new #GalaxyS21Ultra from @samsungindia
.

Under the dove-grey, I watched a murder of crows fly. Naked trees stood still, like watchful sentinels of the primeval forest, that waited for the winds to disturb the dead leaves that rotted in silence on the earth below. As the sun began to set, the arrival of the winds stirred the atmosphere. The crows began to caw and the leaves started to rustle. We called it 'the awakening', where creatures of the approaching night used the sounds of the forest at sundown to conceal their movement. This was an incredible time to encapsulate a story. My aim was to capture the awakening with my new phantom black galaxy device and I was greeted by none other than the phantom black himself.

I‚Äôve spent the last few weeks in the wilderness, chasing the fleeting winter light and here are a few photographs to kickstart the year. Sorry for being inactive, I‚Äôve been gathering lots of content and I can‚Äôt wait to share it with all of you.
.
.
The elephant and otters were photographed from a motorboat. I‚Äôve been doing a lot of boat safaris recently and it‚Äôs an incredibly refreshing perspective that I look forward to mastering soon. Stay tuned and sending all of you lots of love and light from the winter forests.

They say a leopard can‚Äôt change his spots but I know one that can hide them.
.

January is always such a beautiful time to reflect. I‚Äôve been in the jungles, waking up with the birds and sleeping under canvas. It‚Äôs so important to disconnect, put your phone off and turn your soul on. I hope all of you are having a beautiful start to the year and here‚Äôs a midsummer memory from many seasons ago of a leopardess and her shadow ghosting through the Elder Forests.
.
.
Note: The leopardess was slightly out of focus but I used a sharper image of her and merged the two.

2020 opened our eyes and helped change our perspective in many ways. During the pandemic, I was fortunate to isolate in the jungle and when Samsung asked me to be their Galaxy Expert, I had to explore the wilderness in a new and challeging way. I wanted to push the boundaries of phone photography and create visually powerful images that told a deeper story. The end result is a series of photographs that widened my perspective and portfolio.
.
.
It's been an incredible journey and my #EpicResolution for 2021 is to uncover new jungles with these versatile galaxy devices and bring you new stories.
.
.
Here are a few of my favorite phone pictures from last year. From giant elephants to little butterflies and vibrant tigers to elusive black panthers, which one was your favorite?

The jungle can be a dark place, but her shadows cannot exist without light. Deep in her distant chambers, life will always find a way.
.
.
Here we are again, at the very end, eager to abandon the past, yet we must not forget. As we enter a new era of man versus nature, we must use shards of the past to carve out a new way of living. We‚Äôve always longed for a better future, and the future is now here. Be the change we seek, for we are who we‚Äôve been waiting for. The time has come to manifest our destiny.
.
.
Happy new year everyone! Make a resolution that resonates around the essence of better living, sustainability and reconnecting with the earth.

Here are a few images from a series called ‚ÄòIn Search of Light‚Äô. Lots of love and light to all of you! See you on the other side.

New morning, new life.
.

Somewhere between the hills of Nyamalumba and Bologonja, lies a hidden valley and nested into its oblivion, lived a little family. Day by day, a new morning broke as if it were the earth‚Äôs first. The air was full of hope and promise of new beginnings. Slowly but surely, after ever sunrise the family grew and I‚Äôll never forget the first day I met them. A pair of blue eyes peered at us from a little thicket. A glimpse was all they gave us until the fifth day, when her mother carried her out to us. There‚Äôs nothing more beautiful than earning their trust and together we enjoyed the serenity of another beautiful morning. What a beautiful world.

‚ÄúWe are interconnected. Our existence bound together. We are both the hunter and the hunted, threads in an intricate tapestry woven by the web of life. This is the structure of our reality, where all beings may seem as transient as the leopard and the monkey, but are actually eternal, like the jungle.‚Äù ¬©

A few lines from a chapter called the ‚ÄòValley of Shadows‚Äô in my book. It‚Äôs so good to have the time to write again and explore a new world. The book is loosely based on a fantasy forest riddled with secrets, folklore and photographs. It‚Äôs still a work in progress and I‚Äôm excited to share it with you in 2021.

Join me in February 2021 for an incredible African Safari to the short grass plains of Ndutu in Tanzania. I‚Äôve hosted Safaris here over the past decade and now have my own private camp @royalmigrationcamps right on the marsh, where I will be guiding, teaching photography and post processing. The camp has four rooms, four exclusive Safari vehicles and me as your host.
.

Ndutu‚Äôs marshlands of life and death have been one of my most favourite places on earth to photograph wildlife. These short grass plains in Southern Serengeti summon the over a million wildebeest every year for the great calving.

Beauty lies in the finest of details and in every detail lies a story. I‚Äôve documented these three individuals for many years and after many scars and broken whiskers, it‚Äôs incredible to know the stories behind every little detail.

We‚Äôve all grown up in awe of the mighty tiger, but it is the leopard and her deft movement that sparked my love affair with the jungle. These incredibly elusive, crepuscular, agile and adaptable animals are always a challenge to photograph, especially when they descend the tall trees of the South.
.
.
Understanding your subjects are so important to getting better pictures. A faster shutter is often required for females that are usually smaller and more agile. They tend to descend head first and fast. Large males (second image) will give you more time as they descend the other way.

‚ÄúDeep in the Elder Forests, the tribesmen led me to their place of worship. The earth was still dark and in the distance, the silhouetted ‚ÄòTrees of Enlightenment‚Äô waited. We sat under the Holy Fig, a giant Ficus that was over 3000 years old. Her luminous leaves were said to flicker even on the darkest of nights.
To our left loomed the Sivadruma, the Big Bael tree that was integral to healing the tribe and keeping the forest united. Her trifoliate leaves symbolised the unity of humans, animals and the forest. In silence we wait, for the arrival of dawn as the herd of Deer nearby gathered. The first light was said to be the most divine, where bygone tree spirits rose into the sky to pass messages from this world to the next.‚Äù

A short/draft excerpt from the book I‚Äôm currently finishing. I‚Äôve used this year to finally pen my thoughts into a book and I hope to publish early next year. It‚Äôs riddled with tales and photographs of an enchanted forest.

The photograph is an artistic rendition. It‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve created some environmental surrealism and this edit was inspired by the chapter I was writing.

The Jungle is Watching

Here, in the depths of the jungle, you are being watched. Her eternal tapestry woven by both life and death. The great wheel of nature must turn and the deciduous trees that shed their leaves must yearn, for here in the endless garden of Eden, you are born and you are always being watched.
.
.
I spent a few days on safari recently, guiding guests and I absolutely love the romance of a dense and leafy forest. The mood was perfect for building suspense and I captured this footage from a simple Nikon DLSR. Photography is not just about grabbing footage, It‚Äôs about breathing in the scene and telling a story of how your perceive the world around you. It doesn‚Äôt need endless equipment and time, it needs your untainted imagination.

Follow the bed of fallen leaves towards the setting sun. At dusk, you shall arrive at the very beginning, and under the silhouette of twisted trees, darkness will be born. A cold wind blows in the silence that grows, so follow the bed of fallen leaves and wait by the burning sun, for winter is near and her ghosts are here.

Another October rolls over as the forest grows colder. The winter winds promise change as the Elder Trees shed their leaves. The November sun, sharp as the shadows it casts, shall burn twice as bright for half as long. Deep in this forest, winter is coming and on an early morning, at the gates of dawn, I met the first winter visitor in the mist.

I love spending time alone and my best companion in the jungle is solitude. I was enjoying a quiet afternoon in my verandah when I couldn‚Äôt help but feel as if I was being watched. I looked to my left and there he was, a beautiful Indian chameleon peering at me through the leaves. Together we enjoyed the sunset and I managed to capture the most distinct set of eyes in the animal kingdom with my @samsungindia #GalaxyNote20Ultra as a part of my #WFN - Work From Note challenge. I used the Live Focus mode to bring the eye into focus and the camera did very well given how good the chameleons camouflage is.

There‚Äôs a beautiful mystery that resonates around an old bull elephant that evokes a sense of calmness. His wisdom can be felt and anyone in his presence, knows that he commands not just silence but also the trees around him, the earth he walks on and the skies above. What a magnificent being.

They say it‚Äôs darkest just before the dawn but have you ever seen the flight of a black swan?
.

This photograph was probably one of the most difficult photos I‚Äôve ever taken. My hands were trembling, the panther was flying and I knew I only had seconds. This animal was moving at an incredible speed but after years of understanding his movement, I‚Äôve learned the unorthodox ways of getting my focus right on a subject that was as black as the night.

The forested hills of South India are filled with untold stories and a thousand unseen sunrises. Each hillock to me resembled a house of god, a place of absolute calm and serenity. On a windy evening, we climbed the nearest peak as the westward winds carried the monsoon rain. At the very top, the forest felt most pure, a place to wash your spirit clean. Upon arrival, we were greeted by a disciple of the holy hills. She was the keeper of this kingdom, a spiritual presence that vanished as quickly as she appeared.
.
.
Shooting wide allows me to capture every layer of the forest, in the hope that it tells a deeper story. With so many untold stories nestled in these woods, I always look forward to uncovering them with my Galaxy devices. I used the @samsungindia #GalaxyNote20Ultra 5G on Pro Mode, to capture the divinity of this moment. At 108MP, the nearest blade of grass to the furthest mountain peak was in focus. Here‚Äôs a picture of a young leopard ghosting through this enchanted landscape.

I‚Äôve spent the last week exploring the forest at dawn with my new @samsungindia #GalaxyNote20Ultra and on a beautiful monsoon morning, I captured one of my favourite elephants journeying through the woods.

It‚Äôs hard to describe Africa, her rhythm needs to be felt. The air was as pure as ancient wisdom. On some nights, I‚Äôd sit under the Baobab tree and listen. The stars were always clear and I could sit and talk to god as if nobodies here, and even if they were, nobody cared, we‚Äôre lost in memories of thoughts that nobody shared.

I created this vintage series of Africa to help signify it‚Äôs natural purity. Beauty in simplicity, void of colour, to portray the power of the ancient and the magnificent.

The roar of a tiger is undoubtedly the most powerful sound I‚Äôve ever heard. But what fascinates me is how, we as humans, can‚Äôt hear frequencies below 20hertz. This infrasound can travel huge distances and can cut through dense forests and mountains with ease. Some studies have shown that they can produce sounds at 18 hertz and even lower when roaring. How incredible, to be in a forest, where animals are always communicating, and not always hear them.

Imagine if these trees could talk, what would they say? A wider perspective allows us to capture the true essence of the jungle. It tells a different story as every leaf of every tree in the forest is brought into focus. Over the past year, I‚Äôve enjoyed exploring with my Galaxy devices, as they help me uncover the jungle from a unique perspective. Today, on #WorldPhotographyDay, I‚Äôm celebrating with the new Galaxy #Note20Ultra and I can‚Äôt wait to go on Safari with this incredibly powerful device and see what it has to offer. Stay tuned! @samsungindia @samsungwithgalaxy #withGalaxy #shaazjung #nature #wildlife #ad
Today, on World Photography Day, I‚Äôm going to start with celebrating the leopard who shaped my destiny as a photographer. My journey began with Scarface. He was fathered by one of the most powerful leopards and mothered by a leopardess with eyes as blue as the summer sky. His parents withered away in the winter winds of 2009 but in those winds of change, something stirred. Twilight beckoned and on an eerie summer evening in 2010, a new king was born. He wore a scar as deep as the woods and little did I know, he would grow to be my mentor and rise to be one of India‚Äôs most iconic leopards. Over time, he introduced me to his kin and I started to learn more from these leopards than I did from humans.
.
.
Scarface taught me patience, compassion and most importantly how the flow of time is not cruel but beautiful, if you allow it not to control you. As humans, we are obsessed with chiming the hour and I as I counted the years and watched him age, I feared his loss. He on the other hand cared not for the passing of time and lived with absolutely no fear of time running out. He taught me to live by the day and not measure the hour, he showed me how to find a little slice of eternity in this enchanted forest where we both dwelled.
.
.
Today he is 12 years old and still as agile as he once was. I know he doesn‚Äôt have long but it‚Äôs about the journey not the destination what a journey it‚Äôs been. What a magnificent cat.

It‚Äôs been an incredible journey and we‚Äôre just getting started. Thank you for the endless love and support. More to come very soon, including some exciting giveaways (cameras, phones and safaris). This page is your portal to the wild, see you in the wilderness!
The best decision I ever made was to put my career as a photographer in the hands of the people. We‚Äôve come a long way together, in a world full of endless discovery where we weren‚Äôt afraid to dream. A million of us have gathered here today. This success is not mine, it‚Äôs ours.

A veil of mist blanketed the trees and an ominous silence hung in the air. Even the songbirds didn't dare to sing and only the steady hum of crickets pierced through the atmosphere. At dawn, I sat under a Yellow Teak tree and waited. I could feel his presence, as cold as the frost that gripped my fingers. On his arrival, I chose to capture the essence; a wider perspective of the phantom in his ghostly opera of trees.
.

I used the @samsungindia S20 Ultra to capture this magnificent animal in his beautiful habitat.

Humanity has a lot to learn from nature‚Äôs symbiotic and selfless relationships. On a warm afternoon under the African sun, a giraffe quenched her thirst and allowed her loyal flurry of Oxpeckers to cool off after every sip. These mutual friendships in the wild signify the importance of unity and the art of living together.
.
.
The giraffe and her birds were best friends. They fed on her ticks, in return the giraffe is kept clean and together they found ways of solidifying their friendship. What a beautiful world.

Welcome to Karnataka, land of the giants.
.
.
What a memorable evening this was. @russ_wildlife and I were out the entire day with two male tigers sizing each other up in the thicket. With no breakfast, no lunch and down to the last bottle of water, we were absolutely parched. With herds of elephants around us, the opportunities were endless and leaving wasn‚Äôt an option. Finally, at sundown they emerged, from opposite ends of the looming bamboo. Our hands were shaking from hunger and excitement and the footage needed some serious stabilisation, but here‚Äôs a teaser and to catch the entire sequence, watch our Natgeo film ‚ÄòThe Real Black Panther‚Äô.

On International Tiger Day, here are three photographs on my most favourite tigress. We call her Kismet, the daughter of the waters and the true queen of our lands. She was fathered by a fallen legend and mothered by a tigress called Ghost. Blessed with powerful genes, no one ever doubted Kismet‚Äôs journey to the top. Kismet means destiny in the local language and it was truly her destiny to rule the promised land.

This enchanted forest is home to some of the most elusive animals. A wider perspective, shot on my @samsungindia S20 Ultra, shows the true depth of the jungle. The giant trees, dense foliage and perineal streams, make this the perfect abode for predators like the black panther.
.
.
On a dreary monsoon day, I found myself under the ancient Banyan. In the distance, the nights first owl spread its wings. As the sun began to set, there was a brief moment of silence. In that stillness, something moved and the night began to walk.

The western corridors of the jungle were a mystery and even the tribes refused to venture into its endless abyss. I‚Äôve spent years skirting the boundaries, in search of her secrets but the entangled trees and impenetrable foliage guarded the unknown.
.
.
On a cold winter morning, I entered the labyrinth. In the distance, beyond the blue veil of mist a shape took form. Finally, after years of wander, I met the keeper of this kingdom. What a magnificent beast.

The arrival of the birds, the rising of the sun, the gathering of herds, the forest now as one, the dragonflies are here, summer light in their wings, the spiders weave their webs with magic in their strings, the turtle doves call as the sun begins to fall, the elements await, for the tiger to summon all.

I have travelled the world and photographed many animals, but none as regal as the mighty tiger.

My photographs of this magnificent creature went viral this week. Though I took credit for most it, it is the panther‚Äôs enigmatic beauty, often lit by his luminous eyes, that deserve all the applause. I want to take this opportunity to thank all of you, those that have dropped me some of the most touching messages this week, and to those who have followed me on this beautiful journey from day one. You guys are my inspiration and I hope this animal has inspired you to visit our beautiful Indian jungles.

I‚Äôve had the privilege of watching Kismet, a beautiful tigress, come into her own over the years. She was only a month old when I first saw her in 2014 and here I am, six years later on the same old beaten path, following her trail.
.
.
A few days ago, on a warm afternoon, she led us to a nearby stream. As soon as we heard her chuffing, a non threatening vocalisation used between tigers to communicate, we kept our distance and waited. After an hour she emerged from the stream with three little cubs. It was so important to give them time and space to trust us. It took an hour of silence and once we gained their respect, they allowed us into their world.

Ah, to be back in the wilderness and reconnect with the creator. I've spent the last few days with myself, rediscovering the path and it's led me to some beautiful beings. Whoever said rainy days should be spent at home with a cup of coffee, hasn't spent a day getting wet in the jungles of the monsoon. .

Here's a short video, I've quickly put together, of the jungles right now. Damn, it feels good to be back and the highlight of my week was this beautiful Sloth Bear in the rain. .

Darkness. And when the path fades, the moon once told me to follow the silver grass blades. .
.
I‚Äôve always been infatuated with the forest at night. To watch the moon hang quietly in the distance as silhouettes of trees danced to the midnight winds. To sit in that eerie yet profound silence and feel that heightened sense of awareness. What a fascinating world, buried in obscurity. Riddled with secrets we can never unravel. So here we are again, in my mind, as I imagine what a tiger in the forest could look like on a moonlit night. .

Hi everyone, I‚Äôm happy to announce that I have signed with Samsung as their ‚ÄòGalaxy Expert‚Äô. Thank you @samsungindia for sending me the S20 Ultra. I‚Äôve been using it on various projects over the past month and I cannot wait to unravel the jungle with this incredibly powerful phone. Here is my first ultra shot of a beautiful Indian Chameleon. They have the most distinct eyes!

That lonely feeling, when the forest goes eerily silent but you know you‚Äôre not alone. That paranormal sensation where you can‚Äôt help but feel like you‚Äôre being watched. On most days, I look around and see nothing. But sometimes, when the wind dies and the leaves stop swaying, your eyes meet their eyes. .

The jungle is always alive, always watching. .

Let‚Äôs say, every night I had the power to dream any dream I wanted. Every night I used this power to full-fill every pleasure and every adventure. As the nights passed, I had to dream deeper and deeper, in pursuit of greater pleasures and bigger adventures. I had to explore the furthest corners of my imagination, until one night, I finally dreamt of where I am now. .
.
This philosophy, inspired by Alan Watts, has helped shape my creative vision. My dream is to always embark on a visual quest and turn those visual discoveries into reality. My work aims to transcend this reality and create dreamlike settings where the viewer is often lost between the dreamworld and the real world. To portray wildlife as art is a beautiful dream where the artist within breaks free from the boundaries of photography. .
.
The mind is a powerful place to explore your creativity, full of endless discovery, and what a beautiful world I‚Äôve discovered. .

We are oblivious to the beauty around us. It‚Äôs so easy to lose our sense of awe in everyday reality and the more we see things, the more invisible they become. Deer are the perfect examples, they were an animal I would see everyday. I always admired their beauty, but because I could see it on any day, I never truly did. .
.
I recently received an order from France for artistic prints of Deer. Thousands of images later, I realised none were worthy enough of being printed 10ft tall.
Fortunately, I was isolating at our Farm House and this image was recently made in our garden, of a beautiful pair that belonged to the resident herd. I spent many evenings there and because I saw them so often, I began to see them less. Well, not anymore! .

From the Archives | In my early days of guiding safaris, big bull elephants in ‚Äòmusth‚Äô weren‚Äôt my favourite animals to encounter on the track. The number of times I‚Äôve had to put the pedal on the medal, with the jeep in reverse, is far more than I‚Äôd have liked. There‚Äôs no bigger rush than taking a blind turn on a beaten track and coming face to face with a giant, but as a guide, you‚Äôre responsible for everyone in the jeep. Not many understand the dangers of an angry bull and I think most guides would agree that it can sometimes be nerve wracking when you‚Äôre leading a Safari with clients. I absolutely love elephants but the jungle has taught me to respect them most. .
.
‚ÄòMusth‚Äô is a condition in bulls that makes them highly aggressive due to high levels of testosterone. These levels can be 50 times greater than an elephant that isn‚Äôt in musth. These bulls often discharge a thick secretion called ‚Äòtemporin‚Äô from their temporal ducts on the side of their heads. .
.
I photographed this elephant with my Nikon D3000 and 70-300mm in 2010 and it was the only image I took before I quickly realised what was happening.

Life Under Canvas | Africa

The beauty of Africa and the freedom she offers always resonates powerfully with me. I can pack my bags, travel to far away lands, set up my own Camp, follow the great migration and relish life in its truest form. A life under canvas and under the constellations that sparkled over the endless Serengeti but most importantly, a life that that made me feel small amidst natures grandeur. .
.
Here‚Äôs a tiny glimpse of what it has to offer, a few memories from my most recent visit, where we set up @royalmigrationcamps in the heart of Africa and left with nothing but footprints.
It‚Äôs my mother, who first taught me to love the wilderness and admire its beauty. I was raised in the wild, in the hope that I would one day connect with it. She continues to inspire me and I‚Äôm celebrating this Mother‚Äôs Day with Samsung, by putting my mom in the picture. You can do the same and win a Samsung Galaxy S20! Upload a picture with your mom and tag @SamsungIndia using #MothersDay and #withGalaxy.

What a journey, to unravel the secrets of a forest and follow its faithful few. Each animals had their strong individual characteristics that helped shape mine and a leopard we named ‚ÄòMist‚Äô, will always hold an important chapter in my book of life. .
.
.
‚ÄòMist‚Äô, easily distinguished by her torn right ear, is usually seen on the mistiest of mornings. Her ghostly abilities, to drift through this forest unseen, are second to none. The first picture in this series was photographed in 2012 and was the day we christened her. That was only our fifth sighting of her, the first being in 2010 and all five were on misty mornings. Here are a few photographs, in extremely low light, of Mist over the years on her favourite blue mornings. .

During my quarantine, I was fortunate to came across these two magnificent reptiles. A beautiful Green Vine Snake, that needed to be rescued from a clueless mob of humans, and an Indian Chameleon (swipe to see), in the agricultural fields, with the most distinctive eyes worn by any creature in the animal kingdom. .
.
I chose to edit them against a black background to highlight their vibrant beauty, which often gets lost amidst the green foliage, due to their spectacular camouflage. .

The Jungle

The essence of the jungle lies not in being found, but in getting lost. There‚Äôs an abundance of beauty that lies between these trees and an air of secrecy that looms under the canopy. Here are some of Kabini‚Äôs secrets and a few of my favourite memories from the past year. Please watch it with headphones. .

In the dense forests of Kabini, the overpowering canopy often conceals the sky. So when the panther emerged and walked towards the fleeting colours of the setting sun, I knew I was witnessing something special. Yes, he did pause to give us a look, but there was something extraordinarily peaceful about watching the most enigmatic cat, walking into one of the greatest skies I had ever witnessed. .

In the wilderness, I‚Äôve often learned that what you‚Äôre looking for comes when you‚Äôre not looking at all. The ‚ÄòAfrican Wild Cat‚Äô has always eluded me. I was up just before dawn, when I heard the Guineafowls alarming by my tent. Their calls have led me to many treasures in the African bush but never did I think I‚Äôd see this gorgeous and elusive wildcat staring at me as I emerged from my tent. What a beautiful morning. .

I always grew up in awe of the mighty tiger, but it is the leopard and his deft movement that sparked my love affair with the jungle. Over the past decade, I‚Äôve spent many safaris winding down the beaten path and my journey was shaped by the rise of three kings. .
.
In the jungle, kings are not born, they are slowly moulded by the elements, until the day arrives for them to announce the start of their reign. I dedicated my life to the Eternal Trio and never will I forget the three most important days when they crowned themselves king. .
.
Meet Torn Ears. He belongs to the Eternal Trio and is the oldest and wisest. We named him after he traded half of his ear in a fight, in exchange for half of Odin‚Äôs territory (the one eyed Bisalwadi male). It was on this day, on the most dramatic wooden thrown, that Torn Ears announced himself to the world. He went on to become the most revered leopard in the area, a living legend. .

The forest was filled with birdsong, pure and ethereal. I spent many evenings with an old friend; the value of it seldom known until it was lost. Together we watched many a sky die and together, we existed in harmony as the cuckoos sang to the passing winds. Winds that will forever carry whispers of a Temple and its eternal followers. .

This was Monk, the original Temple Male of Kabini who ruled this 300 year old Chola temple from 2005 to 2014. Monk passed at age 13 but his aura shall always light the walls of this temple, like it did on that monsoon evening in 2013. .

Lions, their grace and power unmatched. True kings, each wore their battle scars, a reminder to all that none shall pass. Their godly aura commanded the earth around them and like Norse Gods and fallen Kings, they drank blood from curved horns and waited for their kin to be born. The fate of their kingdom relied on unity and together they were untouchable. .

Here‚Äôs a short video of the resident brothers at our Ndutu Camp. Odin and his pride lived with us and hunted by us. Similar to my style of photography, I love to experiment with my videography and mould them around my favourite songs. It may or may not work but i enjoy being creative.

The Hunt

Day one in the Serengeti. I set out on a morning drive with our first arrivals, ten avid photographers led by @dr.shashank.b.gowda for Jungle Sutras. At the crack of dawn, the first Fowls cried and as the sun broke the mountains of Makarot, we set out in search of a Cheetah and her two cubs. It didn‚Äôt take long to find her. She lay hidden in the tall grass by Lake Ndutu. Thousands of Flamingos flocked in the distance. The key was to park not with the Cheetah but by the Gazelle. Hours passed and by late afternoon she emerged, unnoticed and determined. I‚Äôve witnessed hunts in Ndutu‚Äôs short grass plains but never on the lake bed with flamingos in the backdrop. Africa, you are special. .

Hello world, I‚Äôve been lost in the Serengeti the past 10 days and it‚Äôs been the most soulful experience. Our camp is nestled in the woodlands of Ndutu, where I‚Äôve been teaching photography and guiding clients from all corners of the world. I‚Äôve met some wonderful people and shared many magical moments with them. To witness the Wildebeest calving and see life take form in front of our eyes is far too powerful for me to put into words. The unending circle of life here is so vivid and with the wildebeest we‚Äôve encountered melanistic wild cats, stripped hyenas, big bull elephants, majestic male lions, leopards, cheetahs hunting and so much more. I‚Äôve had absolutely no time to process any of my videos and pictures but here‚Äôs a picture from the Nosikito pride that love to climb trees by our camp. .

If you‚Äôre free this March, come spend time with me at our Luxury Camp here in Ndutu where I‚Äôll be guiding and teaching photography and post processing. Email me at info@shaazjung.com .

An eerie glow of first light hangs between the trees, silhouettes of branches dance without their leaves, wicked is the wind that waltzes thick as thieves, frigid is the mist for in it something breathes. .
.
This image does absolutely no justice to what we had witnessed that morning. We drove out at first light and watched darkness lift to reveal nothing but ambiguous shapes in the thick mist. We parked ourselves under the old Banyan, where he was seen the day before. The silence was deafening and dawn was like the dead of night. No songbirds sang, no crickets hummed yet there was an eerie sensation of being watched. Spending years on the same track, tracking the same animals, strengthens your intuition and within minutes a ghostly figure slowly took shape on the road ahead. It drifted by us in absolute silence and was by far my most chilling experience with the black panther. .
.
View my story for the BTS video. At this point, the light was far better but the image above was shot in extremely low light. I‚Äôve played around with it in post to revive some light but kept it dark to try and retain some of it‚Äôs original vibe. .

There‚Äôs something inexplicably beautiful about the melancholic mist and how it transforms dawn into an eerie land of the lost. The paths may seem deceptively apparent and it‚Äôs destinations unknown, but don‚Äôt be afraid to wander in the mist, for he who walks the endless path shall find the greatest treasures. .

Ndutu‚Äôs marshlands of life and death have been one of my most favourite places on earth to photograph wildlife. These short grass plains in Southern Serengeti summon the over a million wildebeest every year for the great calving. It‚Äôs an absolutely magnificent place to witness the circle of life. .
.
Join me this year in Ndutu at my own camp and Safari with me as we track big cats and follow the wildebeest migration. I will be teaching photography and post-processing. The camp is open from February onwards through March. We only have a few slots left so check the link in my bio or visit my website and book your safari with me now! .

This year was about exploring the unexplored and understanding the unfathomable. My 2019 belonged to the worlds most elusive. Over 150 sightings, 8TB of images, 50TB of footage, a National Geographic film and lifetime of unforgettable memories. We spent ten hours a day, everyday, trying to understand the black panther but true wisdom in the jungle is knowing you know nothing about its true origins. Everyday was a journey into the unknown, as we attempted to unravel the secrets of a cat very few have documented long enough to understand not just his character, but also the little idiosyncrasies that make him unique. The result is an overwhelming portfolio, and possibly the first in the world, of a melanistic leopard in the wild hunting, mating, fighting and thriving against the odds of natural selection. I want to thank all of you for being a part of my journey this year. The jungle can be a lonely place but thanks to all of you, never have I felt alone. Nature is where it all begins and I hope my work this year has inspired you to fall in love with the wilderness and visit the jungles. Have a wonderful new year and see you on the flip side. Shaaz

Kipling may have based his book on the forests of central India but it is here in the South where his fantasy is my reality. His characters are the protagonists in my life, in a forest that is home to some of the most charismatic and elusive animals. All these pictures above were photographed within 30 square kilometers in Kabini (Nagarhole). What a magical place to coexist. .

Another winter day and I‚Äôm hanging with my kin, the wolf winds howl in a valley full of sin, cats weave through my tapestry string by string, I got the whole jungle balanced on a pin, my songbirds sing to the paper white moon, if they hum the right tune white flowers start to bloom, my night is as dark as the Drongo‚Äôs plume, another winter day born in a winter womb, the sun entombed as my canvas fades to grey, my sketches are reflections of another winter day, my scribbles are perspectives as the day fades away, another winter day, another winter day. .

I‚Äôve always been fascinated by winter and the power it holds to stop life dead in its tracks. Here‚Äôs an artistic rendition of what the jungles of South India might look like under snowfall and who better than the solitary tiger and the lonesome Drongo to play the protagonists on my winter canvas. .

Let me tell you a little story about leopards of the light, the sun know their names, the moon shudder at their sight, the birds sing in flight as the last winds blow, the leaf that falls from your tree of life will no longer help you grow, there‚Äôs wisdom in the air as the leopards start to shine, there‚Äôs a fable in the woods whispered by her creatures left behind, sunsets and rosettes as darkness waits in vain, never forget your roots said the old Banyan, so a part of you can always remain. .

My dream is to live in a little cottage somewhere in the foothills of East Africa, where I can wake up every morning to the sounds of the first fowls calling from the endless savanna. It‚Äôs hard to describe Africa, her rhythm needs to be felt, her air so rare. In her lands, I don‚Äôt envy the birds, for I am as free as the sky and no cage ensnares me. I felt unbounded, lifted like leopards of the first light. .

A carpet of leaves blanketed the ancient jungle, old as Adam. Fallen branches, untouched, rotted in silence as far away stars still shimmered, happy in their silver-solar isolation. The coming of dawn conjured a warm glow of first light that hung between the trees of life. On most days, the moss ridden trail, freckled with leaves, would lead to a nearby stream, but the secrets of the jungle lay not in the ordinary. The essence lies in our ability to wander away from normality. It wasn‚Äôt about uncovering secrets, it was about daring to dream in her world. .

In a world fast being urbanised, the concrete jungle now has a new meaning. This series was printed seven feet tall and exhibited in Mumbai, Sweden and Australia. It aims to exemplify the unfolding tragedy of lost corridors and I used migratory animals to signify this best.

Portraying wildlife photography as art to evoke emotion and thoughts, has been one of my greatest passions. We live in a beautiful world, a dying world that needs a voice. We need support, more open minds, more photographers to experiment, more artists to dare, more love and less judgement, so we can bring more people into the arena to help signify the vanishing world we live in. .

The trees loomed wicked with no leaves in it, each like a watchful guardian; silent sentinels of the eternal forest. The monsoons impenetrable heart of tangled foliage was slowly being carved apart by the frigid winds of change. At dawn, we arrived at the gates, where the trees fell away and revealed first light in the gravel-grey sky. A wolf moon hung quietly in the distance as the timid sun delayed its arrival. The haunting ballad of a solitary songbird pierced through the frost bitten woods. Winter was near and her ghosts are here. .

I spent the last few days exploring the jungles with the new @samsungindia #GalaxyNote10 and absolutely loved the new features and versatile camera. Low-light images in Pro Mode captured the hues of dusk and dawn beautifully while photographs in daylight were crisp and vibrant. I enjoyed juggling between the Ultra Wide and Telephoto modes and it was refreshing to capture wildlife with a different perspective.
.

The first image of an elephant was shot in the early hours of dawn. I used the Pro Mode to control my settings during the photography session.

The second image is of a tigress cooling off on a warm monsoon afternoon. With the Ultra Wide camera, I enjoyed capturing the habitat around her.

These portraits were displayed at my recent exhibition and aimed to signify hope; a light at the end of the tunnel. I captured these captivating expressions and created an artistic blend between darkness and light to help get my message across. Our wildlife is on the brink of extinction, well over a thousand times higher than the natural extinction rate. As our ecosystems continue to collapse, their future lies in your hands and in our ability to coexist and understand how important wildlife is to maintain a healthy ecological balance for our earth. .

On my canvas, my ghosts aren‚Äôt white, their souls are void of light, my haunted brush paints shades of black darker than the dead of night. .

I‚Äôve always been fascinated and connected to the colour black. It absorbs all colours and reflects none to the human eye. It symbolises the unknown, mystery and supernatural power. As a Racket Tail Drongo drifted through the woods, for a split second, it went invisible and that was the power of black. This one is dedicated to all of you who love this colour and draw strength from it. .

My jungle will lure you in, with paths that are deceptively apparent and secrets that will never be uncovered. Silver starlight may show you the way, shapeshifting shadows will lead you astray, so open your eyes, I shall show you a world etched deep in my mind and free from your kind. Only the greatest explorers of the unknown, those who are willing to lose themselves, can unravel the enigma, for the essence of the jungle lies not in being found, but in getting lost. .

I studied the jungle and drew intricate patterns of shadow art, tracked creatures of the moon with an astrological chart, I‚Äôve seen the flight of a Ghost-bird and how it changed through the seasons, how her swan-song summoned a Phoenix to defeat all the demons, I‚Äôve followed the sun through its cycles, followed ancient tribes who gathered their disciples, I‚Äôve immersed myself in the jungles endless knowledge bases, but not a step closer to understanding the basics.
.
.
For a moonlit vibe, who better than the night himself? It‚Äôs hard to comprehend how easily this animal would probably blend into the night. Hard to visualise how ethereal it may be to see him in nothing but the moonshine. As obscure as darkness, we‚Äôd be oblivious to his presence but for the occasional hints of luminous eyes and white canines. In search of the unknown, here‚Äôs a visual concept of what it could look like, however the real magic that resonates around it lies in the fact that we will never know. .

Scarface drinking the rain

There is something inexplicably beautiful and tranquil about the elements of nature. I‚Äôve spent the last decade documenting this individual leopard we call Scarface and watching him drink the rain was probably one the most beautiful moments we‚Äôve shared together. What a magical world.

This was one of my first artistic edits back in 2012, when Photoshop in wildlife photography was considered a sin. What a journey it‚Äôs been, to introduce photography as art and help magnify this magnificent world. The birth of ‚ÄòEnvironmental Surrealism‚Äô is a style I created that aims to evoke emotion and thoughts by depicting a magical yet vanishing world. It isn‚Äôt everyone‚Äôs cup of tea, but portraying wildlife as art was a milestone and it gives me immense pleasure to now see more people experimenting with their work. .

#shaazjung #nikonasia #nikon #wildlife #nature #wildlifephotography #earthpix
The jungle, full of murk, full of mystery. Hidden between these trees lie many untold truths and at dawn I unlocked a secret of the monsoon; the infamous Indian Sloth Bear. .

This was shot on the new Nikon Z7. The light was low, the leopardess was treed up by Wild Dogs and we knew her descent was going to be fast. We positioned at a distance, far enough to give her ample space but I chose to use a 600mm prime that would be tight enough to get a full frame vertical. I didn‚Äôt want to push my ISO past 1000 and to gain a faster shutter on Aperture priority I underexposed by -1. I was still not fast enough but this was a potential print worthy sighting and my aim was to get a picture with the Z7 at 45 megapixels rather than using my D4s that would have given me a higher FPS. At a shutter of 1/500 I knew the only way to possibly get this right was with a slight pan. The dogs vanished into the distance and within seconds she started to descend. Fortunately she gave us a quick look before the final descent and that allowed me to lock my focus. As she descended in quintessential leopard like fashion, I gently panned in the same direction of her movement. As you can see, the bark of the tree and foreground is slightly out of focus due to the motion blur created by the pan, but the leopard is tact sharp. The results of the camera and pan were astonishing. There was no noise, beautiful colours, and a full frame leopardess leaping in full frame dimensions of 8000x5000 pixels. .
.
Note: Firstly, I couldn‚Äôt have done this without understanding the tree first. Always take a minute to study the tree the leopard is on. Understand the angle of its branches and predict how she may descend. This allows you to position yourself better. Secondly, understanding and respecting your subject is equally important. Give them space whilst knowing what comes next, makes it easier for you pre-visualise and compose your frame. We‚Äôve followed this leopardess we call Mist for 8 years now. This is the 5th time we‚Äôve seen her get treed up by Dogs. Older leopards like Mist prefer to descend face up but when troubled by Dogs they always descend facedown to see if the path ahead is safe to sprint into. Facedown means a much faster leopard which requires and a whole different array of settings. .

In a valley of silence, I drifted into its cosmos, carried away by the first winds, like last leaves from trees of the ancient. There I sat, beneath the night and waited for the coming of dawn. Silhouettes of branches, like out stretched arms, crept through dying starlight. Silver dew-laden grass shimmered as the forming of poltergeist-white mist buried the forest in obscurity. There‚Äôs something inexplicably beautiful about misty mornings; it‚Äôs opacity doesn‚Äôt allow you to see far. The uncertainty keeps you anticipating but you‚Äôre never quite ready for what‚Äôs to come. There was no greater thrill than discovering the unknown, no greater feeling than loosing yourself in this jungles esoteric wisdom. The cuckoo sang to the effortless artistry of how the first light painted the night away with its infinite palette of colours. Dawn had arrived and I couldn‚Äôt think of a better place to be alive. .

Shadows of the undergrowth, full of murk, full of mystery. Witch-light creeps deep to reveal its tapestry.

I‚Äôve always been fascinated By the leopardesses oracular fashion. Her mysterious ways will forever perplex me but what baffles me most are her whiskers and how she uses these sensory appendages to interpret and navigate the world around her. Each whisker has over a hundred nerve receptors that can pass information to other parts of her body. She uses them to sense even the smallest vibrations, like the changing of air currents, to help her decipher the environment in a way no human can. The diameter of her whiskers is wider than the width of her body, allowing her to accurately judge the distance between objects. This is most useful when hunting at night as she can map the nearby vegetation and approach prey with incredible agility and silence. .
.
We call this leopardess ‚ÄòMist‚Äô and in the early hours of a misty morning, her white whiskers stood strong against shadows of the fading night; a night where she experienced a world we will forever be blind to. What a magnificent creature.

The arrival of the birds, the rising of the sun, the gathering of herds, the forest now as one, the dragonflies are here, summer light in their wings, the spiders weave their webs with magic in their strings, the turtle doves call, the last leaves fall, birdsong in the wind, welcome to the Butterfly Ball. .

Here‚Äôs a photograph of Kismet, the resident tigress, and her son. The love he has for her is unquestionable. They are absolutely inseparable but what I loved most about this sighting was to just sit there and imbibe how alive the jungle was on that summer evening. We sat on a little hillock with four tigers around us as flocks of parakeets glided by. The babblers babbled, the hawk cuckoo sang, distant cries of deer and the unmistakable hooting of a Fish Owl occasionally filled the air. Dragonflies, bees, butterflies were plentiful and the forest looked in absolute harmony as the cubs called out to their mother. It was truly ethereal and the this coming together of wildlife is something I like to call the Butterfly Ball. If you‚Äôre quiet and patient enough, you might just be invited to one. .

It‚Äôs been a decade since we christened him Scarface, a decade since I had my first encounter with Boor. Between these trees, I‚Äôve witnessed the making of two iconic leopards, an eternal pair.

Ten years have passed and here they were, still creating life on ancient trees, still as deft as the summer breeze. .

Who knew that the winds of Kymara would someday bring home a creature that would slowly become the soul of this forest. He rules the tallest trees, commands the flight of ravens, directs the clouds and brings new order to a timeless jungle that now radiates around his enigmatic aura. He is the perfect paradox and without a doubt the hardest cat I have ever tracked. He is my biggest challenge and my greatest reward. This is not a Marvel movie or a Kipling story for he is as real as the monsoon rain and he is here. .

There‚Äôs infinite hope, keep searching, for it‚Äôs deep in the darkness where life starts emerging. .

Earth has lost half its wildlife in the past forty years but there‚Äôs still hope. The aim of my portrait series at my recent exhibition was to signify light at the end of the tunnel. .

Dawn of a new year, full of moments that have never been. A windstorm of change beckons and may the leopard find you this year as a better man. .

Happy New Year to all of you. Thank you for making 2018 everything it was. This Instagram family has taken me to the most beautiful places and introduced me to the most wonderful people. I hope all of you find what you‚Äôre looking for this year. Lots of love from the unending bush and see you in the wilderness. .

Will you still be there,
When the mist fades away,
And giants of the last march,
Gently fade to grey,
A summer breeze of dead leaves,
Shall slowly pave the way,
As giants of the last march,
Are summoned to their grave. .

The elephant population can be awfully deceptive. Don‚Äôt be fooled by their numbers just because they move in large herds. They may have a large presence geographically but we‚Äôve lost over 60 percent of elephants in the last decade, averaging a hundred deaths a day.

Like the fading mist, you are witnessing a massive vanishing.

My exhibition titled ‚ÄòLight and Shadows,‚Äô is an embodiment of the philosophy that has shaped my vision as a photographer and artist. My style blends the elements of nature in an artistic way that is meant to evoke a sense of mysticism; a style I like to call ‚ÄòEnvironmental Surrealism‚Äô. The fading mist, transient clouds and dramatic play of light are meant to signify the vanishing world of wildlife. .
.
The aim was to cater to an audience that was more inclined towards art, an audience that wouldn‚Äôt usually adorn their walls with wildlife photographs. The exhibition went extremely well. We were sold out on day one. The unique blend between photography and art had a powerful impact that captured the attention of a wider spectrum. Wildlife photography in India is still trying to break free from the shackles of ‚Äòpurity‚Äô and I urge more of you to experiment with your work, especially if it has the potential to educate people and create an impact. Our wildlife needs it. India needs it. .
.
A HUGE thank you to @varuntalreja84 and @estaa__ for making this happen. What an amazing team. Thank you to all those who attended the event (I know the traffic was awful). For everyone who missed it, my work will be exhibited at Estaa Gallery in South Mumbai till the end of Jan.
The ‚ÄòClouds of Change‚Äô is another mini series in my upcoming exhibition. Here, I use fleeting yet overpowering elements like the transient clouds to signify the vanishing world of wildlife. .

An ode to all the leopards I‚Äôve loved and lost. Some to the gods and some to the deeper jungles. Here‚Äôs an image of Hook, a leopard I followed from his first month to his second year. This picture of him was my last. It‚Äôs been three years but something tells me I‚Äôm going to see him again. .

A leopard can‚Äôt change his spots, but I know one who can hide them. I‚Äôve tracked many cats but none like the panther. The darkest of coats belong in the deepest of jungles and on a cold winter morning, when a rare ray of light filtered through the canopy, I saw something I had never seen before. Many tribes have been here, but only a few have seen the rosettes of a wild black panther. .

Under the dove grey sky, the winter crows fly and the world below was void of all colour but for the red petals that fell from the nearby Gulmohar. Silver witch-light crept through the ghostly silhouettes of endless trees as a thick blanket of mist enveloped the woods. There was nothing more peaceful than watching it fade, nothing more enchanting than waiting to see what it may reveal. This forest was full of mystery, begging to be uncovered. Winter was finally here. .

For the ghostliest of them all, the art of camouflage lies between shadow and light. For when the cuckoo announces the arrival of summer, and the leaves slowly fade to dying shades of amber, the leopard moves in imperceptible ways. .

Life has taken me many places and down many roads, but it is off the beaten path that I choose to wander. I‚Äôve walked with elephants, swum with sharks and tracked apex predators for a living, so it isn‚Äôt a surprise when I find myself occasionally looking death in the face. There are nights I still wake up and see this male lion charging at me. The wilderness has a tremendous bounty of dangerous beauty with creatures that remind us of how raw and unpredictable nature truly is. .

Can you see the poppy-red sunrise give birth to a warm shine, and the dawn of a new day spark life with a new ray through a flower child outline? Can you see the children of the forest waltzing with nature, can you breathe in the fantasy and exhale life like the creator? Can you hear the teak leaves falling and the emerald dove calling? Do you see the magic I see on a cold winter morning? .

A murder of crows drifted into the forest. Their clairvoyant abilities often sensed an arrival. Silhouettes of monkeys gathered on the outstretched arm of a tall teek tree as the steady hum of crickets swallowed the last birdsong. Darkness neared and as the crows took flight, the nights faithful appeared. .

Many many moons ago, one of the first tigers I ever tracked sat beside a little rivulet. She had two little cubs, a male and a female and little did I know they would both change my life forever. The male grew to be one of the most iconic tigers this jungle had ever seen. Euco, also known as the backwater Male, was a phenomenon. It‚Äôs been four years since his passing and the forest is still searching for balance. The female, a carbon copy of him, grew to be the epitome of beauty. She holds the territory her mother once did of an area called Balle. I‚Äôve seen many tigers ghost through this forest but none as deftly as Bella. Her movement reminds me of the forming of rain clouds that slowly yet inevitably brought change. We knew the rain was imminent, but its patterns were unpredictable. Bella‚Äôs incalculable ways made her a nightmare to track, but it was this unpredictability that led to her success, making her one of the most skilful hunters of our time. Together we hold memories that run as deep as the roots of the old banyan that she often resides under. I‚Äôve tracked her for nearly a decade now and she is undoubtedly my most favourite tigress. .
.
None of this was ever about photography, it‚Äôs about love, life and history. .

As a tracker who specialises in studying leopards in dense forests, the joy of finding that perfect opening in the endless canopy, is unsurpassable. When she opens her arms and her layers of leaves part, look for the most bent branch, for in this forest, the most contorted trees often carry the most elusive leopards.

In the jungle, who is the bravest of them all? Is it the regal tiger, nonchalant in his manner, or the ever adaptive leopard, forever fearless in his ever changing world? Neither, for the Indian Dhole (wild dog), unperturbed in the midst of chaos, was the true king. These are the most intelligent and ruthless animals the jungle has to offer and on a warm afternoon, we watched a pack of dholes torment a herd of elephants. This image to me portrays their unruffled nature best as their focus lay on a herd of deer rather than the raging giants. .

Believe it or not, this is my first ever post of an African Wild Dog. I spend a lot of my time in Ngorongoro and the Serengeti where dogs aren‚Äôt as common as they are in other parts. We were having a cup of tea at Camp when one of the guides spotted a pack of three running across the little marsh in Ndutu. The dogs moved past the marsh and into the woodlands where it is near impossible to get a decent picture. Past the woodlands lay the border and we knew this was our only opportunity before they crossed over and vanished into Serengeti‚Äôs oblivion. The light was beautiful but with the light the dogs looked average at best. We quickly drove to a little opening and waited against the sun. The Alpha emerged and stopped for a quick second which gave me an opportunity to capture something different. .
.
Photography tip: Backlight images aren‚Äôt rocket science but here‚Äôs a little tip that always helps. I personally believe that the background is more important than the subject. I often like to frame my backlit subjects at a slight angle and not with the sun directly behind. I then prefer to place a shadow behind the subject, void of any light whatsoever, so my bokeh stays dark. This accentuates the rim light and also merges the shadows of the subject with the darkness of the bokeh giving it a creative touch that can be worked on further with simple post processing. Ps: Remember to experiment with your white balance when there‚Äôs a play of light. It can really define the mood. .

On Day 11 of #30days30posts I want to take you back a decade. .
.
Scarface was just finding his feet in this forest then and like him, so was I. Together we explored the jungle‚Äôs little pathways, ancient trees and narrow ravines. He was still shy but after months of keeping my distance, he finally allowed me to get closer to him on a dreary monsoon evening where he sought shelter under the Yellow Teak tree. .
.
As the cuckoo sang to the falling rain, I struggled with my camera. A basic Nikon D3000 with a 300mm. The light was awfully low and the shutter was as slow as the water that trickled down the leaves of the tree that loomed above us. I managed one sharp image. The quality may not be as good but this memory will forever be etched in my mind. The day Scarface allowed me into his forest. .

The world is flat for the old king of the marsh. As far as the eye could see, from the blades of grass under his feet to the distorted silhouettes of wildebeests in the distant heat, everything belonged to him, but it was the night he wanted most. For when the dust settles and the hills of Makoma swallow the sun, he shall rise. The Masai called it the ‚Äòawakening of death‚Äô. .

The broken alleyways that weave through little villages on the fringes of the forest, both in India and Africa, carry an unexplainable sense of purity where less is truly more. These children that belong to the wilderness run with shoes that have no laces, carry bags with broken zips, with lunch boxes that have no lunch, on streets that have no street lights, and I promise you they are happier than you and me. .

I saw it in his eyes that day. He finally knew what I had known since his birth. The days of wander were here and he had to now embark on a dangerous path to freedom. They say life is a journey, but in the world of the leopard, death was always one wrong step away. His journey hardly promised life for he was against the odds. Raised by Cleopatra and as the son of the undisputed Scarface, I knew he would be well protected but the inevitable forever knocked on his trees. A time would come where his parents would become his mortal enemies and that time was now. .
.
He who was most adaptable is now most vulnerable. As Scarface watched every move from his throne-like perches on his favourite trees, his son slowly vanished, like the forests of today.
.
.
I spent two years following this leopard. It‚Äôs been three years since I‚Äôve seen him and every time I pass this tree I look behind it and I know a day will come when see him again, with his mother‚Äôs eyes and his fathers build, as the new king and a worthy successor to Scarface; the epitome of all leopards.
.
.
May the bloodline remain strong. .

Photography; a funny old practice many refuse to acknowledge as art. They taught me the rules and it was only after unlearning everything, did I excel. To all budding photographers out there, let your guards down, experiment and shoot for no one but yourself. Go paint a picture with your mind, not click one with your finger. .

Many years ago, when I first arrived at this forest, I often sat around a fire with the locals. Farmers who despised wild animals and tribesmen who worshipped them. For hours we spoke about the jungle, it‚Äôs animals, the conflict, changing weather patterns, hidden pathways, ancient trees and the clouds of mystery that loomed over Kabini‚Äôs canopy. Deep into the night, as the embers of the dying fire would slowly fade, we would often end the day talking about the giant that walked these lands. The farmers prayed he wouldn‚Äôt enter their fields and the tribesmen prayed he‚Äôd forever bless their lands with his eternal existence. They called him ‚ÄòAira‚Äô which was derived from Airavata, the mythological elephant who carries the Hindu god Indra. Airavata was believed to have multiple tusks and the tribes believed ‚ÄòAira‚Äô was immortal and could shed his tusks and grow them again as time passed. I spent many years in search of him and it was only when the first bamboo started to flower again, did Aira appear. .
.
The forests and its magical animals are essential to our survival. It‚Äôs no wonder ancient scriptures and Hindu mythology gave them such importance and respect. Know your origins. Protect them. .

We‚Äôve named many a leopard but none as apt as ‚ÄòMist‚Äô. From the cold winter months of 2010 to the summers of 2018, this elusive leopardess is often seen on the most mistiest mornings. Today she is raising the Black Panthers first litter; two beautiful 3 month old cubs (not melanistic). Shortly after this picture, the entire family spent the next hour on a twisted tree that gave us many wonderful moments. More to come from Mist and her new family! .

The forest that morning was full of life. Breathing, humming. And as the great wheel turned, the deciduous trees shed their leaves, reminding us that nothing is meant to last. Like the scents of summer, everything fades. The forest is forever living. Forever dying. This is the circle of life, and we watched it revolve as Scarface robbed a doe of her first fawn. The jungle has always been raw, It‚Äôs ways at times unfathomable, yet it‚Äôs lessons unforgettable. .

No matter how dark the night, the whites of a tiger never fail to glitter through the floors of the tangled jungle. .
.
Technical Photography tip: The tiger has to be my most favorite animal to photograph in low light. The colors of twilight, with the right white balance, can really fire up their orange coats. Many try to obtain a fast shutter to help capture movement and is arguably the right thing to do, but the result is a sharper image that is often shattered by noise. My advice is to embrace the low light and wait for the subject to stay still, you only need a second. I shot this at ISO 2000 at F4 at a shutter of just 1/15th of a second at a burst. Of the 10 images fired, one was crisp and thats all you really need. .

An elephant logs fallen trees to a nearby forest camp to avoid wood from being smuggled by poachers. I understand many are against this practice but the history of logging in South Asian forests run very deep and has been engrained into the culture over the past few centuries. Similar to the relationship between a Mahout and his elephant. In today‚Äôs world, a lot of this may seem unnecessary and cruel but for the people of the forest, this is their way of life. This is their culture and it will soon erode like many ancient practices. I am against the domestication of any wild animals and in no way glorifying the logging industry. I‚Äôm just portraying it as a dying tradition that I recently witnessed. üôèüèº

And there he was at the gates of dusk, his dawn was never distant nor was his sky ever starless. His eternal scar was a door to our past yet the face I was looking at was not as timeless as it was once. It‚Äôs a funny thing; time. Our obsessive need to chime the hour has us forever drowning in it‚Äôs depths. Deep down I knew I would end up loving him without him for much longer than I loved him when I knew him. I wish I didn‚Äôt, but I couldn‚Äôt help notice today how much he had actually aged.
We had spent a decade together and I could write you a story behind every little crease you see, a map of scars that tells an incredible journey of a cat that needs no introduction. .

Tigers are often quilled by Porcupines at a young age when they‚Äôre extremely curious and playful. They usually rest in water and over time manage to remove the quills unless it‚Äôs embedded deep in their paws. This can be fatal as it hampers movement and their ability to hunt successfully. .
Wadi, was not just one of the oldest tigresses in the park, she was also my first. It was unusual to see such an old and experienced tiger get herself into such a predicament. Over the next few days we saw her sitting in the nearby waterhole but as the days passed so did her existence. Her haunting roars that echoed through the trees of the ‚ÄòBisalawadi‚Äô area will forever be missed. .
Here‚Äôs to Wadi, a true queen that reigned supreme. .
.
Ps: This happened last year. The forest dept kept a close eye on her, cordoned off the area and did everything they could. Sometimes nature has to take its own course. .

Something big lurked in the morning mist and it was only when she emerged from the thicket, did we see what forced her out. Little did we know that this would be the last of her, never to be seen again, for her curiosity ultimately led to her demise. .

From Mastadons to Mammoths and from being hunted to being worshiped, these animals have always fascinated me. My immense love for this giant has always reflected in my work as I‚Äôve tried to depict its prehistoric history and size through unique photographic angles. Here stands an animal that has the ability to create a bond far deeper than any human. An animal that can remember you, whilst you‚Äôve forgotten her. A creature than can sense your character and judge you better than most. .
Many ask how I manage to capture this magnificent beast in such unique angles. Most times, I use remote triggers that allows me to keep my distance but every once in a while, I meet that one gentle giant. Respecting and understanding animals is essential to capturing them in intimate ways. This beautiful matriarch allowed me into her herd and together we built a bond as we spent the evening in ultimate trust. .

The key to happiness is appreciating what you have rather than what you don't and it took a beautiful tribal boy from the forest to teach me that. He could have used a net to catch a basket full of fish but he decided to use a line and only fish out a handful, for that was enough for his family of four. The people of the forest had perfected the art of survival without taking a drop more than what was needed. They believed in longevity and the less they had the happier they were. It's time for us to evolve back. .

Ancient folklore often spoke of a creature that used places of worship to spread natures divinity and spiritual power. He believed the jungle was our religion and the earth was our temple. On a cold winters evening, i sat with him and watched the sun set as birds of twilight sang sweet melodies to the passing winds that whistled by, for that evening, I became his disciple. .

Fresh pug marks led down the road that forked up ahead. The marks were relatively smaller and well rounded. A young male tiger was our guess and he wasn't very far from where we stood. At the fork we listened. To our left the Babblers seemed agitated as the jungle fowl called. The deer stood still and in the distance an eagle sat perched on low branch. To our right, there was absolute silence. We only had time for one road before exiting the park. As twilight approached and the shadows grew, we had to make a decision. We did and there he was. The path we took is for you to guess. What road did we choose? .

Spent the last light with this true chameleon last evening. At times he was impossible to see and lay absolutely still until the sun had set deep beneath the tree line. As darkness approached, he emerged from the thicket and sat by our jeep but it's the subtle beauty of a leopard in the undergrowth that I love most. What an amazing creature. .

Believe it or not, leopards in Kabini still do come spotted and in colour. With the Black Panther being the star attraction, I can't help but feel nostalgic when I edit pictures like these. There was a time, not so long ago, where leopards ruled this forest. No tiger matched the charisma, attitude and nonchalance of Scarface and Torn Ears. As their era slowly comes to an end and the density of tigers rapidly increase, I can't help but wonder if I'll ever get those years back again. Kabini for me will always be a spotted feline on a tree. .

I would like to first reiterate the fact that none of my pictures are taken in zoo's, enclosures or any private conservancies. I've spent my life tracking and photographing wildlife in their natural habitat and all my pictures are of non collared animals that live freely in large national parks. It's been an amazing journey and I've met some wonderful animals and humans along the way. I recently passed the 50k followers mark. To do this organically was difficult but extremely full-filling and I want to thank all of you for taking the time out of your busy lives to like and comment on my work. I wish I could reciprocate and reply to each and every one of your messages but it's not easy when you live in the wild with poor connectivity. Today I shall leave you with one of my most favourite images that basically epitomises my life in the jungle. It's always a game of hide and seek and the Panther plays it best. More often than not, I'm on the loosing end but on that stormy monsoon evening, I won. .

Rise of the reaper, sparks from the first light, fresh as the ether, bright from the dark night, listen to the silence, cold as his anthem, elements find balance, for this is dawn of the phantom. #leopard #wildlife #wildlifephotography #natgeo #bbcearth #earthcapture #love #africa #serengeti
The water sparkled, hints of moonlight blue crept through the shadows but were no match for the shades of orange that burned ever so softly. Her spiritual presence demanded divinity and so I gave her a setting worthy of her existence. .

This monsoon is full of surprises. Tracked and spotted the panther again last evening. What a rush! #blackpanther #panther #leopard #wildlife #wildlifephotography #nature #love #safariwithshaaz #thebisonresort #bbcearth #earthcapture #nikon #natgeo
For those who don't know, my grand uncle, the Nawab of Pataudi, rose to being one of the most feared batsmen and captains the cricketing game had seen. With only eye, his words still resonate with me. He said "many believed I was at a disadvantage with only one eye, how wrong they were. My sight may have halved but my vision doubled."
.
As the one eyed king sat there, his mane as dark as the approaching night, I noticed he was the oldest. He owned the largest pride in the southern Serengeti and I couldn't help but wonder whether it was his good or blind eye that guided him through his journey of life. #lion #wildlifephotography #wildlife #love #africa #natgeo #earthcapture #bbcearth #serengeti #tanzania
The clouds that day had betrayed the monsoons as the setting sun found every possible angle to creep through the canopy. With barely any rains over the last week, most of the roads were dry; an unusual sight for the forest in July. We set out that evening in search of the Balle Tigress, known to us as Bella, who had recently given birth to two cubs. I had spent the last six days trying to get a glimpse of them but in typical Bella like fashion, she remained as elusive as a black swan on a moonless night. The hooting of a Brown Fish Owl from the road ahead indicated that there might be a pocket of water nearby. Brown Fish owls are often seen near water that attracts frogs and other reptiles. We followed the low wavering call until it led us to a little bridge. The sound of a little rivulet was as soothing as a breath of fresh winter air in the woods. We listened for a few minutes, lost in tranquility until the owl took flight and disappeared into the unending tree cover. .
As explorers of these woods, there was nothing more satisfying than turning the ‚Äòfour wheel drive‚Äô on. Climbing the bridge onto the other side had infinite prospects that were far too promising. We climbed up and somewhere in the distance sparkled the last of the flowering Gulmohar. Hints of fading red were reignited by the sun and the canopy‚Äôs green cover shimmered like never before. The warmth and the colors it exuded were ethereal and uncommon to any monsoon I had witnessed. Within seconds of crossing over the langur monkey cackled and shook my senses back to reality. Someone in the backseat whispered ‚Äòpanther‚Äù and there he was, far too close to us, on a beautiful Teak tree, nestled comfortably between the large leaves, in typical leopard like fashion. .
After much excitement, I had only one frame in mind, and that was to place the flowering Gulmohar behind him. We drove further away and positioned ourselves and waited for the sun to descend a little more before it triggered a flurry of reds and green.

Today is Global Tiger Day but for a few of us who live in the forest and dedicate everyday towards tracking, studying and understanding this creature, everyday is tiger day and with less than 4000 left in the world, we need all the help we can get. I'm a naturalist and guide before being a photographer and my job is to educate and raise awareness. There's no doubt that photography can be used as a powerful tool to do this but 'liking' this picture can only do that much. I would love for all of you to become more aware of the nature that surrounds you. They are birds that still sing in our cities, trees on our streets that are over a hundred years old and forests less than a 100 kilometres away from your favourite Pub. Understand your surroundings and don't be afraid to explore. Don't be afraid to disconnect from your social life and reconnect with yourself. I promise you will find beauty, peace, magical creatures and a part of you that you never knew existed. We are animals, after all, and the human race can do with a bit of de-evolving. #wildlife #wildlifephotography #globaltigerday #bbcearth #earthcapture #tiger #thebisonresort #safariwithshaaz #love #nikon #natgeo
Fresh from this evenings safari. I'm still numb. Not much more I can say. We spent sundown with the worlds most elusive cat. Note: A full frame shot. #blackpanther #panther #leopard #bhageera #wildlife #wildlifephotography #kabini #thebisonresort #bbcearth #earthcapture #natgeo #love
Spent the morning with this beautiful leopardess we call 'Link'. Seven years ago we watched her mother, 'Tuka', raise two cubs. Many moons later, Tuka is no more but one of her female cubs has taken over the same territory her mother once owned. She's our only 'link' to Tuka, a leopard who was very dear to us. May their tribe grow. #leopard #wildlife #wildlifephotography #natgeo #bbcearth #earthcapture #love #kabini #thebisonresort

The power of a cat is often accentuated by the light she draws towards her and on that cold winter morning she wore the backlit sun as if she owned the sky. Note: A tiger scent marks by spraying a mixture of urine and scent on trees to communicate with other tigers. .

A tigress spends the evening having a little snooze in her waterhole. I love she drifts away and is woken up by her nose going underwater.

Natures symbiotic and selfless relationships have always fascinated me. On a warm afternoon, the giraffe quenched his thirst and with his help so did his loyal flurry of Oxpeckers. What a wonderful world. #safariwithshaaz #wildlifephotography #wildlife #nature #instalike #instagood #africa #africaundercanvas #tanzania #kenya #giraffe #love #bbc #bbctravel #natgeo #earthcapture
Very few can evoke emotions as deep as the setting sun. The old African bull is one of them. Every wrinkle has a story to tell and somewhere along the decades and thousands of miles treaded, his path led to me. A large bull they call Equinox particularly enjoys his sunset mud-bath at the Selenkay Conservancy in Amboseli. We spent a week tracking him and his Askari. May your tusks remain small for evil follows the mighty. #elephant #wildlifephotography #wildlife #instalike #instagood #africa #amboseli #selenkay #nature #love #kenya #africaundercanvas #bull #tusker #bbctravel #earthcapture #natgeo #nikon #nikonindia #safariwithshaaz
